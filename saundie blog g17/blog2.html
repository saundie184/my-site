          We completed our first project! This application is designed to engage middle school students in current news. They will be able to search for news stories by choosing their own search term. Stories are displayed with the newest items on the top. The
          publication date is also shown, so students can immediately see which stories were published today. I used AJAX to call the Guardian API to query news articles based on a search term. The categories (sections) are also displayed next to the
          articles with icons. Since the students can pick any search term, they will be able to see how news stories (from a variety of sections) may contain information that they care about. I used Bootstrap for the CSS and Bootstrap glyphicons for
          the icons. I created a map object that matched each section name to the icon. Since the Guardian has a lot of sections, I created a default icon for cases where the section name was not listed in the map. This project gave me more experience
          with JavaScript, jQuery, APIs, and specifically with handling errors and default cases.
          <br /br> Application: https://whatintheworld.firebaseapp.com/ Screencast demo: https://vimeo.com/146939181 I was very excited to deploy my first application! It feels good to build something that works! I’m currently working on deploying it as a Chrome
          App. One of the students in my class gave a lightning talk on Chrome Apps. He provided lots of links and a demonstration of how to set it up. I need to make some changes to fix some of the CSS, but it will look pretty sweet when it does work.
          I’m also hoping that my friend will test this out in her middle school Current Affairs class.

          Wow. It has been a very BUSY last two weeks. Almost everyday, we learn an entirely new concept. I’m going to be using this blog to document what I am learning. It’s going to be a crazy ride for sure, but it’s starting to get exciting. We were introduced
          to the DOM, aka the “Document Object Model”. I had never heard of the DOM before this week, but I learned why it is so important to programming. We practiced using JavaScript (with the DOM) to build and style pages—no CSS. We also learned about
          event handlers in JavaScript. These add actions and behaviors to web pages. This is where things got really exciting for me. With event handlers, we can make real activity happen. Right now, I’m just adding click actions, but we worked on building
          a piano keyboard and toggling stoplight colors. Finally, we met Bootstrap. Best introduction yet. Building CSS from scratch was cumbersome for me, and Bootstrap is so much faster. It’s a CSS framework with lots of goodness built in so I just
          have to come up with really snazzy HTML. I’m still learning the ins and outs of Bootstrap, and I need to understand the framework better, but it’s been great so far. One of the Galvanize members, Jochen Wolters, came to speak to us during a
          “Lunch and Learn” this week. He talked about UI/UX design and demonstrated the importance that we, as developers, have to understanding how it works. He also emphasized how we need to be ensure there is good communication between design and
          development teams. I love how his talk was about how “tech meets the end-users”. We really have to consider how our work will be functional for users (humans). If we build programs for end-users, this critical. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jochen_wolters/an-introduction-to-ben-shneidermans-eight-golden-rules-of-interface-design">You can click here to view his presentation on SlideShare.</a>

          Another thing I’ve been working with more is GitHub. Versioning is so important! My motto this week: Build more stuff!

          This is the end of week one in gSchool, and I’m learning so many new things. Every day, we are introduced to new content and then we immediately are asked to apply it. It feels like I am getting a taste of everything, but I haven’t been given the time
          to take in a full meal yet. It is frustrating, and at the same time, exciting. I wish I could master one element, or be able to enjoy a full meal, before I am given the next. It’s like being at a restaurant and trying to take multiple trips
          to the buffet line with your plate still full. Gross. Guess I’ll get over it. This will take repetition, I am realizing. With so much going into my brain, there seems to be little time to put it all into practice. At the beginning of gSchool,
          we were encouraged to take risks and play. I have accepted that I will not know all the tools or even the rules before I start. We worked on HTML and CSS this week. This is a journey, and we are learning as we code, or coding to learn. I am
          enjoying the problem-solving and solution-finding aspects of coding, but I feel limited by my (lack of) knowledge of the tools. For instance, I wish I knew all the elements and selectors and rules to CSS. This would make it feel like I had more
          options available. I do find it valuable to know where to find resources that describe how to use certain tools. Right now, I am spending a lot of time looking things up and finding the solution (or asking someone to explain something) and then
          trying it myself. My motto right now: More playing, more trying, more reading.
